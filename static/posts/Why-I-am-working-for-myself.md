# Why do I want to work for myself?

## Follow my dreams

I always wanted to work for myself, there's just something great about seeing your own ideas come to fruition
I like helping people and want to do that through the form of online courses and free content on my blog and on youtube
I like playing games and have always wanted to make my own games for others to enjoy

## Work on something I am excited about

I've burnt out on working for other people, sometimes projects come along that are slightly more interesting than others, but typically I am pretty bored of doing some incremental feature

## Have more skin in the game

Having 100% ownership of my ideas is something that is appealing to me, if I screw up then I am accountable, if I win big, then I relish in my success, that's very appealing to me, high risk, high reward

## Do something that makes me uncomfortable 

When you are reaching outside of your comfort zone, you are typically going to learn a lot more, and learn more about yourself and grow as a person. I find when I become complacent and comfortable with what I am doing for work is when I am least happy in life. Maybe this is a personal problem, but I prefer to be learning and growing all the time rather than just collecting paychecks doing something that is simple.

I had began to recognize that I was mostly doing the same thing and not really learning much, the main barriers I had to overcome on a daily basis were mainly ones that were self imposed by the company, and that was a point of frustration for me. I attempted to remove the barriers and make things more efficient, but at the end of the day I think it was just time to move on and start my own journey. I wanted to do something that I could be excited about and would allow me to learn

## Help more people 

Through the magic of online content distribution platforms I feel like I can help a lot of people do what I was able to do, and teach themselves programming, or anythign that they are excited in really, and do what they love. I think life is too short to spend 8 hours a day doing something just because you need money. For me, the job was a way for me to catapult into my own ventures by allowing me a period of flexibility and ultimate freedom away from any financial stresses.

What would you do if you had complete freedom to do whatever you wanted for several years?
